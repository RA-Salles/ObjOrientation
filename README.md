Object Orientation Repository
=============================

  What is this repository?
  -----------------------
    This seeks to safeguard progress while learning the OO subject in fga-unb. Mostly code,
    but it seems i'll probably be also keeping txt files, uml stuff and more things like these.
  Project 1: Geometry
  --------------------
    Objective: Pseudocode an app to draw geometry figures, curves and realize simple operations.
    Progress: About 50%. Gotta go and create an uml flowchart for it.
    General Comment: "but it isn't a-" no no no man. It is a flowchart convention. You can't run
    an uml. Deal with it.
  Project 2: Geometry executed!
  --------------------
    Objective: execute pseudocode visualized in project 1
    Progress: quite done. Actually plots the stuff passed. Good thing i got away with useing matplotlib, since
    plotting my own graphs would be quite terrific! Very unfunny. 
    General comment: nothing amazing, does the work. There's some badness and badly optimized stuff, but, 
    as long as the user deal with the fact he SHOULD NOT try to plot thousands of stff at once, 
    it can be useful to quickly plot curves. 
  Project 3: Contract Manager!
  ------------------
    Objective: make a program to manage contracts
    Progress: none. It was only visualized. The pdf will be uploaded shortly.
    General Comment: it will be literally the contract manager i already partially coded
    in another rep. Go into my profile and grab it. It is very funny, very funky.
