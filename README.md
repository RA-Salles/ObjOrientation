Object Orientation Repository
=============================

  What is this repository?
  -----------------------
    This seeks to safeguard progress while learning the OO subject in fga-unb. Mostly code,
    but it seems i'll probably be also keeping txt files, uml stuff and more things like these.
  Project 1: Geometry
  --------------------
    Objective: Pseudocode an app to draw geometry figures, curves and realize simple operations.
    Progress: About 50%. Gotta go and create an uml flowchart for it.
    General Comment: "but it isn't a-" no no no man. It is a flowchart convention. You can't run
      an uml. Deal with it.
